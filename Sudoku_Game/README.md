# 🧩 Sudoku Validator and Player (C Mini Project)

### 📖 Description
A console-based Sudoku Validator and Player built entirely in C.  
The program generates a random Sudoku grid with some pre-filled numbers and lets the player fill the remaining cells.  
Each move is validated in real-time based on Sudoku rules — no number can repeat in the same row, column, or 3×3 subgrid.

---

### 🎯 Features
- Randomized partially filled Sudoku grid
- Real-time validation for each input
- Simple and clear console interface
- Modular program using header and implementation files
- Demonstrates arrays, loops, functions, and input validation

---

### ⚙️ How to Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile
gcc main.c function_definitions.c -o sudoku

# Run
./sudoku
```

---

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of 2D arrays and nested loops
- Hands-on experience with modular programming in C
- Use of functions, header files, and input validation
- Logical thinking through Sudoku constraints

🚀 Future Enhancements

Planned improvements and extensions for future versions:
- 🧩 Sudoku Solver Mode: Implement a backtracking algorithm to automatically solve any given Sudoku puzzle.
- 🎮 Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard puzzles with different numbers of pre-filled cells.
- 💾 Save and Load Feature: Allow players to save game progress and continue later.
- 🖥️ GUI Version: Develop a graphical interface using C/GTK or migrate to Python/Qt.
- 🧠 Hint System: Suggest possible valid moves to guide players.
- 🧪 Unit Testing: Add automated test cases for validation functions.
- 🌐 Leaderboard / Timer: Track player performance and completion times.
